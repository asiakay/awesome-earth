## K-12 Education Resources

- [The My NASA Data](https://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/) website provides resources for students and teachers to explore Earth Science phenomena in the Atmosphere, Biosphere, Cryosphere, Geosphere, and Hydrosphere using NASA-related content. The website offers mini-lessons, lesson plans, story maps, STEM career connections, GLOBE connections, and scientifically interesting stories. These resources provide guiding questions and other teacher tools to help students access and analyze NASA data. The website also features a data visualization tool called the Earth System Data Explorer that allows users to interact with NASA Earth Science satellite data.


## Developer Resources 

- [Awesome-GEE](https://github.com/opengeos/Awesome-GEE) This is a curated list of resources related to Google Earth Engine. It includes links to official Earth Engine websites, JavaScript, Python, and R APIs, GitHub repositories, tutorials, books, and free courses. The list also contains links to Earth Engine apps, projects, datasets, and papers. There are also resources related to QGIS, GitHub developers, Twitter accounts, and presentations. The list is maintained on the Awesome-GEE GitHub repo and is open for contributions.

- [Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED)](https://coded.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#continuous-degradation-detection-coded)
This is the documentation page for Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED), which is a forest monitoring application developed for mapping and estimating the areas of forests affected by forest degradation. CODED is open source and can run on Google Earth Engine, and can be used to monitor and estimate forest degradation and deforestation. The page provides information on the background and motivation for developing CODED, definitions, algorithm description, and versions. It also provides tutorials on how to run CODED using the Javascript API and a Javascript template, as well as a graphical user interface.

- [The Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/geoss.php) builds the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), which links Earth observation, information, and processing systems to provide diverse information for public and private sector users. It facilitates sharing environmental data, ensuring access, quality, and interoperability to develop tools and information services. The [GEOSS Platform](https://earthobservations.org/geoss.php) links existing and planned observing systems worldwide and promotes technical standards. The GEOSS Portal offers a single access point for data and software, and the [GEONETCast network](https://earthobservations.org/geoss.php) provides similar information for users without Internet access. GEOâ€™s global priorities include the Sustainable Development Goals, Climate Action, and Disaster Risk Reduction.

- [NASA Gross and Net Primary Production GPP/NPP](https://viirsland.gsfc.nasa.gov/Products/NASA/GPP_ESDR.html#) The GPP/NPP data products by NASA measure vegetation growth by calculating the amount of carbon taken in and produced by plants through photosynthesis. They can be used to calculate energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. The data is based on a formula that uses light and respiration. Cloud contamination is a problem, solved by using backup methods and year-end gap-filled data products. The data is available in a standard format and useful for understanding plant growth and their role in the environment.
