This is the documentation page for Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED), which is a forest monitoring application developed for mapping and estimating the areas of forests affected by forest degradation. CODED is open source and can run on Google Earth Engine, and can be used to monitor and estimate forest degradation and deforestation. The page provides information on the background and motivation for developing CODED, definitions, algorithm description, and versions. It also provides tutorials on how to run CODED using the Javascript API and a Javascript template, as well as a graphical user interface.
